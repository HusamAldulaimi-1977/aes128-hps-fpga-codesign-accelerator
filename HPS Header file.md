The ARM program developer should remember to use a given Linux shell batch file(generate_hps_qsys_header.sh) to extract the address information to a header file hps_0.h.
launch Altera SoC EDS command shell, go to the Quartus project folder (fpga-rtl), and execute generate_hps_qsys_header.sh by typing „./generate_hps_qys_header.sh” followed by ENTER key.
A header file hps_0.h is generated to be used later in src C program compilation.
